# auth.py (Optional for advanced flows)

# NOTE: This file is placeholder. Streamlit doesn’t support native Google OAuth popups.
# For now, you should copy-paste your Google ID token manually in the UI (as done in app.py).

# If you want to implement real OAuth with redirect, you’d need to:
# 1. Use JavaScript/HTML for login
# 2. Host a minimal server to catch tokens
# 3. Pass tokens back to Streamlit (not easy for local dev)

# So keep this empty or as a future feature placeholder.
